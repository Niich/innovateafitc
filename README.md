Hackathon project

Overview:
IOT enable the critical heathcare devices to enable realtime tracking of usage and availablity.

Devices will be "tracked" using a WIFI connected device attached to the item. The device is battery powered and report the status of its sensor to a central database. 
The device needs to be low power so that it can last as long as possible, goal is more than 2 weeks on one charge/battery.

When a device is enroled with the server its ID will be assosicated with a medical device type. The server will listen for devices to report a sensor reading and an ID code. 
Then the server will determine based on the reading if the medical device is in use or available. 

The information from the server and the managment of the IOT device enrolment/assignment will be hanndeled through a web portal.
